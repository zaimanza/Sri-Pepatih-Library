# Sri-Pepatih-Library
Sri Pepatih Library is located in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. It is a new library that was built around 2018. Every year they restock new books with different genre and subjects. The Sri Pepatih Library is having trouble with detecting their depreciated books. Therefore, they lost many books every year and making them waste money to renew and restock books. The library use a traditional way of book tracking which uses paper. they would have to manually print out and stamp the books based on when it is borrowed. As a solution, we are planning a database structure for the library to systemize the way they keep track of their books.
